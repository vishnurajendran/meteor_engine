# Meteor Game Engine

Meteor is a custom game engine built in C++20, featuring a player and an editor. It leverages modern C++ and various libraries to provide a robust and flexible environment for game development.

## Features

- Built with **C++20** using the **STL**.
- Uses **OpenGL** for rendering and **GLEW** for OpenGL extensions.
- Supports model loading with **Assimp**.
- Incorporates **ImGui** for creating user interfaces in the editor.
- Integrated with **SFML** for windowing and input handling.
- XML parsing with **pugixml**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++20** compatible compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
- **CMake** (version 3.26 or higher) for project configuration.
- **CLion** (optional) for an integrated development environment.

### Dependencies

- [**pugixml**](https://pugixml.org/)
- [**Assimp**](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
- [**GLEW**](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [**OpenGL**](https://www.opengl.org/)
- [**SFML**](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
- [**ImGui**](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

### Installation

#### 1. Installing Assimp

To install Assimp on your system, follow these steps:

- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
  \`\`\`bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libassimp-dev
  \`\`\`

- **macOS:**
  \`\`\`bash
  brew install assimp
  \`\`\`

- **Windows:**
  1. Download the Assimp binaries from the [Assimp GitHub Releases](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/releases).
  2. Extract the contents and add the \`include\` and \`lib\` directories to your CMake configuration:
     - Add the path to the \`include\` directory using \`include_directories\`.
     - Ensure the \`lib\` path is available in the \`CMakeLists.txt\` or your compilerâ€™s library path.

#### 2. Installing GLEW

To install GLEW, follow these steps:

- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
  \`\`\`bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
  \`\`\`

- **macOS:**
  \`\`\`bash
  brew install glew
  \`\`\`

- **Windows:**
  1. Download the GLEW binary package from the [GLEW website](http://glew.sourceforge.net/).
  2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory (e.g., \`C:\glew\`).
  3. Add the \`include\` path (\`C:\glew\include\`) and the library path (\`C:\glew\lib\Release\x64\`) in CMake:
     - Add the path to the \`include\` directory using \`include_directories\`.
     - Add the path to the \`lib\` directory using \`link_directories\`.

#### 3. Setting Up the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Meteor.git
   cd Meteor
   \`\`\`

2. Create a build directory and run CMake:
   \`\`\`bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   \`\`\`

3. Build the project:
   \`\`\`bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   \`\`\`

4. Run the engine:
   \`\`\`bash
   ./bin/MeteorEditor  # To run the editor
   ./bin/MeteorPlayer  # To run the player
   \`\`\`

### Building with CMake

- Ensure that Assimp and GLEW are correctly installed and available on your system.
- Make sure to specify the path to your libraries if they are not in standard directories.
- On Windows, make sure to copy the \`glew32.dll\` or \`glew32s.dll\` (for static linking) to the directory where your executables are built.

### Troubleshooting

- **CMake cannot find Assimp/GLEW**: If CMake cannot locate Assimp or GLEW, you may need to specify their locations manually. You can pass \`-DAssimp_DIR\` and \`-DGLEW_DIR\` to CMake:
  \`\`\`bash
  cmake -DAssimp_DIR=/path/to/assimp -DGLEW_DIR=/path/to/glew ..
  \`\`\`

- **Linker errors**: Ensure that the paths to the libraries are correctly set. For example, on Windows, you might need to add the path to \`glew32.lib\` in your \`link_directories\`.

- **Undefined reference errors**: These often occur when a required library is not properly linked. Make sure that \`GLEW\`, \`Assimp\`, \`SFML\`, and other dependencies are correctly linked in your \`CMakeLists.txt\`.
